# My Learning Journey ðŸš€
This repository is for tracking my personal coding progress. Here, I am uploading my practice codes for Python, Web Development, and, in the future, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and Java.

## About This Repo
Python: Contains basic to slightly advanced Python scripts covering variables, loops, functions, lists, and more.

Web Development: Includes codes and mini-projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Use
To run Python files, use the terminal and type:
python filename.py

Open web files (HTML/CSS/JS) directly in your browser.

Why This Repo?
To track everything Iâ€™m learning in programming.

To save scripts, examples, and projects as I experiment with different technologies.

To have a reference for my progress and revisit concepts in the future.

Future Goals
Complete Python basics and move to advanced topics.

Build simple & fun web development projects.
